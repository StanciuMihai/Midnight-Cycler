# Midnight-Cycler
A side-scrolling platformer game made in C# using .Net Framework 4.7.2 
Help the bicycle rider get as far as possible while dodging the obstacles.
Hold the Space Bar to accelerate or release to slow down.
The grey platforms are safe to ride on, while the colorful ones will get you a game over.
Have fun!
